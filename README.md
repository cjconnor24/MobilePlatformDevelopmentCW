# Quake Trackr

This application was designed and developed as part of the [Mobile Platform Development module][2] at [Glasgow Caledonian University][3].

The brief was to create a mobile application which consumed a data feed on UK Earthquakes from the [British Geological Survey][1]. The earthquakes should then be displayed to the user in a meaningful way.
